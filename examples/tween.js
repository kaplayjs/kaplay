/* ðŸ¥Š Challenge #1 ðŸ¥Š
In line 32 and 42, we use the linear easing function. But there's a lot of
easings with which you can create cool effecs. Try with one of these:

- easings.easeOutQuint
- easings.easeOutQuad
- easings.easeInExpo

You can also check all easings in action in the tweenEasings example.
