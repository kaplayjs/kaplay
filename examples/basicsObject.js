// Adding game objects to screen [ðŸ’¡, ðŸ¥Š]

/* ðŸ’¡ Game Objects ðŸ’¡
A Game Object is the base of all entities in KAPLAY. It's composed by components.
*/

/* ðŸ’¡ Components ðŸ’¡
A component is a function that adds behaviour, methods and properties to a
Game Object.
*/

kaplay();

// We load sprites with loadSprite(), it receives the asset name and the path to
// the asset.
loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png"); // Bean, the frog!

// You can add a game object to the screen using the add() function, which takes
// an array of components. We can store the result object in a variable.
const bean = add([
    sprite("bean"), // sprite() is a rendering component that draws a sprite on the screen.
    // pos(120, 80), // pos() is a component that sets the position of the object on the screen.
]);

debug.log(bean.sprite); // Prints the sprite name

/* ðŸ¥Š Challenge ðŸ¥Š
Try uncommenting the pos() component, it receives and x and y coordinates
and sets the position of the object on the screen.

Then try logging the position coordinates of the object using

debug.log(bean.pos);
