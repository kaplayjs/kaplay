# Contributing to KAPLAY

Hey! Welcome to the Contribution guide, thanks for your interest in contributing
to KAPLAY.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), >24.X.X
- [pnpm package manager](https://pnpm.io/), >9.1

## Cloning the repository

```sh
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay.git # to clone the repo.
# Enter to project dictory
cd kaplay 
# Install dependencies
pnpm install 
# Run dev command
pnpm dev
```

## Editing examples

1. Pick on example to test and edit the corresponding `/examples/[name].js`, or
   create a new file under `/examples` to test anything you're working on.
1. The source entry point is `src/kaplay.ts`, editing any files referenced will
   automatically trigger rebuild. **Make sure not to break any existing
   examples**.
1. Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server and try examples.

## Documentation

KAPLAY API documentation is auto-generated by JSDoc comments in the source code.

Normally the definitions of components, types, interfaces (i.e: `SpriteComp`,
`Vec2`, `RectComp`, `LifespanCompOpt`) are on their own files. For example

- `src/components/draw/sprite.ts` for `SpriteComp`
- `src/math/math.ts` for `Vec2`
- `src/components/draw/rect.ts` for `RectComp`
- `src/components/misc/lifespan.ts` for `LifespanCompOpt`

Your best option is use **ctrl + click** on the type to go to the definition and
see the JSDoc comments. Other option is to use the search feature of your IDE.

## Commiting your changes

1. Follow our [conventional commits](#conventional-commits-guide) format. You
   can see how seeing the commit history.
2. `pnpm run check` to check TypeScript.
3. `pnpm run fmt` to format.

## Conventional Commits Guide

This guide should be followed for all commits to the repository, and also for
issues and PRs.

A commit starts with a type, a scope, and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- The **type** is mandatory.
- We don't use the **scope** right now, you must omit it. This may change in the
  future.
- The subject must be a short description of the change. Use the imperative,
  present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
