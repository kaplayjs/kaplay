## Developing kaplay

1. `git clone https://github.com/marklovers/kaplay.git` to clone the repo.
1. `cd kaplay` to enter the project directory.
1. `pnpm install` to install dependencies.

## Editing examples
1. Pick on example to test and edit the corresponding `/examples/[name].js`, or create a new file under `/examples` to test anything you're working on.
1. The source entry point is `src/kaboom.ts`, editing any files referenced will automatically trigger rebuild. **Make sure not to break any existing examples**.

## Before commit
1. follow conventional [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. You can see how seeing
   the commit history.
1. `npm run check` to check typescript.
1. `npm run fmt` to format.

## Documentation

Most kaboom docs are written in `src/types.ts` as [jsDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) above each kaboom component entry.

**Help on improving the documentation is appreciated! Thank you for contributing!**

## Conventional Commits Guide

You must follow the following rules when writing commit messages:

A commit starts with a type, a scope, and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- The **type** is mandatory. [Should be one of the following](#commit-types).
- We don't use the **scope** right now, you must omit it. This may change in the future.
- The subject must be a short description of the change. 
Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
