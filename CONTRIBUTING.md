# Developing KAPLAY

<!-- markdownlint-disable single-h1 heading-increment fenced-code-language -->

We're currently working in two branches:

- `v3001`: the branch for v3001. This is the branch you should use to fix bugs
  on v3001 and v4000.
- `master`: the main branch, where we develop v4000. This is the branch you must
  use to develop new features.

When you publish a PR with a fix for v3001 and v4000, you should create 2 PRs,
one targeting `v3001` and the other targeting `master`. We recommend you using
[`cherry-pick`](https://dev.to/hakki/git-cherry-pick-a-guide-to-selectively-merging-commits-2i14)
to apply the fix to both branches.

## Cloning the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay.git # to clone the repo.
cd kaplay # to enter the project directory.
pnpm install # to install dependencies.
```

## Editing examples

1. Pick on example to test and edit the corresponding `/examples/[name].js`, or
   create a new file under `/examples` to test anything you're working on.
1. The source entry point is `src/kaplay.ts`, editing any files referenced will
   automatically trigger rebuild. **Make sure not to break any existing
   examples**.
1. Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server and try examples.

## Documentation

KAPLAY API documentation is auto-generated by JSDoc comments in the source code.

Normally the definitions of components, types, interfaces (i.e: `SpriteComp`,
`Vec2`, `RectComp`, `LifespanCompOpt`) are on their own files. For example

- `src/components/draw/sprite.ts` for `SpriteComp`
- `src/math/math.ts` for `Vec2`
- `src/components/draw/rect.ts` for `RectComp`
- `src/components/misc/lifespan.ts` for `LifespanCompOpt`

Your best option is use **ctrl + click** on the type to go to the definition and
see the JSDoc comments. Other option is to use the search feature of your IDE.

Types like the components one (`sprite()`, `rect()`, `lifespan()`) are defined
on `types.ts` file, in the `KAPLAYCtx` interface, this is because what
`kaplay()` returns is a `KAPLAYCtx` object. So even if component files has the
definition, the JSDoc comments are on `types.ts`.

**Help on improving the documentation is appreciated!**

## JSDoc comments

There is the structure of a JSDoc comment:

- The Description of the member.
- `@deprecated` when the member is deprecated.
- `@requires` when the member requires something to work. Usually a component.
- `@param` for each parameter. Each parameter should have - at start.
- `@example` for 1 (and only one) example.
- `@static` only if the value is an static method
- `@returns` for the return value description.
- `@since` for the version when the member was added.
- `@group` for the group of the member.

Example:

````ts
/**
   * Attach and render a circle to a Game Object.
   *
   * @param radius - The radius of the circle.
   * @param opt - Options for the circle component. See {@link CircleCompOpt `CircleCompOpt`}.
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * add([
   *     pos(80, 120),
   *     circle(16),
   * ])
   * ```
   *
   * @returns The circle comp.
   * @since v2000.0
   * @group Components
   */
  circle(radius: number, opt?: CircleCompOpt): CircleComp;
````

## Abbreviations

- `opt` for an options object.
- `pos` for a position vector.
- `dir` for a direction vector.
- `comp` for a component.
- `game obj` word for a game object.
- `lst` for a list of something.
- `action` the callback that is executed when smt happens.
- `btn` button
- `k` in some contexts, key, in others, KAPLAY interface

# Before commit

1. Follow our [conventional commits](#conventional-commits-guide) format. You
   can see how seeing the commit history.
2. `pnpm run check` to check TypeScript.
3. `pnpm run fmt` to format.

# Conventional Commits Guide

This guide should be followed for all commits to the repository, and also for
issues and PRs.

A commit starts with a type, a scope, and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- The **type** is mandatory. [Should be one of the following](#commit-types).
- We don't use the **scope** right now, you must omit it. This may change in the
  future.
- The subject must be a short description of the change. Use the imperative,
  present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".

### Commit types
