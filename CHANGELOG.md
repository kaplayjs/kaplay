best friend, lajbel, can put the correct version name here
-->

## [unreleased]

### Added

- Added chorded button bindings using the Buttons API, so you can bind different
  actions to `tab` and `shift+tab`, and handle them like normal. Also works with
  gamepads and mouse! - @dragoncoder047

- Added `skew` to text formatting, so now italics is possible - @dragoncoder047

- Added **lifetime scopes**, a way to define the lifetime of an event handler
  using a specific scope, `scene`, `app` or a game object - @lajbel,
  @dragoncoder047

  ```js
  app.onUpdate(() => {
      // runs until it is cancelled
  });

  scene("game", () => {
      const obj = add([]);

      obj.onUpdate(() => {
          // runs until obj is destroyed
      });

      scene.onUpdate(() => { // or just onUpdate(() => {
          // runs until scene is changed
      });
  });
  ```

  All the available handlers in the scopes are `GameEventHandlers` ones:
  - `onKeyDown()`
  - `onKeyPress()`
  - `onKeyPressRepeat()`
  - `onKeyRelease()`
  - `onCharInput()`
  - `onMouseDown()`
  - `onMousePress()`
  - `onMouseRelease()`
  - `onMouseMove()`
  - `onScroll()`
  - `onTouchStart()`
  - `onTouchMove()`
  - `onTouchEnd()`
  - `onGamepadConnect()`
  - `onGamepadDisconnect()`
  - `onGamepadButtonDown()`
  - `onGamepadButtonPress()`
  - `onGamepadButtonRelease()`
  - `onGamepadStick()`
  - `onButtonDown()`
  - `onButtonPress()`
  - `onButtonRelease()`
  - `onHide()`
  - `onShow()`

  And this game object handlers may differ when using it with `obj` and
  `scene`/`app`:

  - `on()`
  - `onFixedUpdate()`
  - `onUpdate()`
  - `onDraw()`
  - `onAdd()`
  - `onDestroy()`
  - `onUse()`
  - `onUnused()`
  - `onTag()`
  - `onUntag()`

- Added `app` scope for app event handlers - @lajbel
  ```js
  app.onUpdate(() => {
      // runs until it is cancelled
  });
  ```

- Added `KAPLAYOpt.defaultLifetimeScope` for setting the default lifetime scope
  used for event handlers - @lajbel

  ```js
  kaplay({
      defaultLifetimeScope: "app", // default is "scene"
  });

  onKeyPress("space", () => {
      // runs until is cancelled
  });
  ```

### Changed

- In addition to being the `scene()` function, now `scene` is also a scope for
  scene event handlers - @lajbel

  ```js
  scene("game", () => {
      scene.onUpdate(() => { // or just onUpdate(() => {
          // runs until scene is changed
      });
  });
  ```

## [4000.0.0-alpha.22] - 2025-10-9

### Added

- Added `KAPLAYOpt.types`, `kaplayTypes()` and `Opt` to config specific
  TypeScript Advanced Features (TAF) - @lajbel

  ```ts
  kaplay({
      types: kaplayTypes<
          // Opt<> is optional but recommended to get autocomplete
          Opt<{
              scenes: {}; // define scenes and arguments
              strictScenes: true; // you can only use defined scenes
          }>
      >(),
  });
  ```

- Added `TypesOpt.scenes` to type scenes and parameters - @lajbel

  ```ts
  const k = kaplay({
      types: kaplayTypes<
          Opt<{
              scenes: {
                  game: [gamemode: "normal" | "hard"];
                  gameOver: [score: number, highScore: number];
              };
          }>
      >(),
  });

  // If you trigger autocomplete it shows "game" or "gameOver"
  k.scene("game", (gamemode) => {
      // gamemode is now type "normal" | "hard"

      // @ts-expect-error Argument of type 'string' is not assignable
      // to parameter of type 'number'.
      k.go("gameOver", "10", 10); //
  });
  ```

  The methods that support this are:

  - `scene`
  - `go`
  - `onSceneLeave`
  - `getSceneName`

- Added `TypesOpt.strictScenes` to make usable scenes just the ones defined -
  @lajbel

  ```ts
  const k = kaplay({
      types: kaplayTypes<
          Opt<{
              scenes: {
                  game: [gamemode: "normal" | "hard"];
                  gameOver: [score: number, highScore: number];
              };
              strictScenes: true;
          }>
      >(),
  });

  // @ts-expect-error Argument of type '"hi"' is not assignable to
  // parameter of type '"game" | "gameOver"'.
  k.scene("hi", () => {});
  ```

- Added named animations - @mflerackers

  By giving a name to an animation, you can define more than one animation

  ```js
  const anim = obj.animation.get("idle");
  anim.animate("pos", [0, 5, 0], { relative: true });
  ```

- Added `screenshotToBlob()` to get a screenshot as a `Blob` - @dragoncoder047

  @mflerackers
- Added constraint components for distance, translation, rotation, scale and
  transform constraints - @mflerackers
- Added inverse kinematics constraint components using FABRIK and CCD, the
  latter one can use bone constraints to constrain the angle - @mflerackers
- Added skew to Mat23, transformation stack, RenderProps, GameObjRaw as well as
  a component - @mflerackers
- Added texture uniforms, in order to access more than one texture at a time in
  shaders - @mflerackers

### Fixed

- Now error screen should be instantly shown - @lajbel

### Changed

- Now, you can use `color(c)` with a hexadecimal literal number (ex: 0x00ff00) -
  @lajbel
  ```js
  // blue frog
  add([
      sprite("bean"),
      color(0x0000ff),
  ]);
  ```
- **(!)** `KAPLAYCtx` doesn't use generics anymore. Now, `KAPLAYCtxT` uses
  them - @lajbel
- Now, `kaplay` will return `KAPLAYCtx` or `KAPLAYCtxT` depending if it's using
  Advanced TypeScript Features or not - @lajbel
- `loadShader()` now also checks for link errors as well as compile errors and
  reports them rather than just silently trying to use a borked shader -
  @dragoncoder047
- The debug `record()` function now records with sound enabled like it should -
  @dragoncoder047
- Now `KAPLAYOpt.spriteAtlasPadding` is set to `2` by default - @lajbel
- Transformation and drawing is split now, so the transform can be modified
  before drawing - @mflerackers

## [4000.0.0-alpha.21] - 2025-08-07

### Added

- Added `GameObjRaw.serialize()` for serializing the game object and its
  components. - @mflerackers, @lajbel

  const bean = add([sprite("prefab")]);
  const beanSerialized = bean.serialize();
  ```

- Added `createPrefab()` for serializing an object and register it (or not) as a
  prefab from a Game Object. - @mflerackers, @lajbel

  ```js
  const beanObj = add([sprite("bean")]);

  // Serialize game object and register it as a prefab asset
  createPrefab("bean", beanObj);

  addPrefab("bean");

  // Just get serialized data
  const serializedBean = createPrefab(beanObj);

  addPrefab(beanObj);
  ```

  scenes - @itzKiwiSky
- Added `throwError()` for throwing custom errors to the blue screen, even
  errors KAPLAY can't handle. - @lajbel

## [3001.0.0] - 2024-10-31

### Added

- Added `getTreeRoot()` to get the game's root object, which is the parent of
  all other objects

  ```js
  // get the root object
  const root = getTreeRoot();
  root.add(); // same as add()
  root.get(); // same as get()
  ```

- Added Buttons API for using Input bindings, `onButtonPress()`,
  `onButtonRelease()`, `onButtonDown()`, and it's corresponding boolean
  versions, `isButtonPressed()`, `isButtonDown()` and `isButtonReleased()`

  ```js
  kaplay({
      // bind your buttons
      buttons: {
          jump: {
              keyboard: ["space", "up"],
              keyboardCode: "Space", // you can also use key codes
              gamepad: ["south"],
          },
      },
  });

  onButtonPress("jump", () => {
      player.jump();
  });
  ```

- Added `getButton(btn)` and `setButton(btn)` to get and set button bindings

  ```js
  // ["space", "up"]
  debug.log(getButton("jump").keyboard);

  // change the jump button in keyboard to "w"
  setButton("jump", {
      keyboard: ["w"],
      // gamepad binding is not changed
  });
  ```

- Added `getLastInputDeviceType()` to get what was the last pressed device

  ```js
  onButtonPress(() => {
      const lastInputDevice = getLastInputDeviceType(); // keyboard, mouse or gamepad
      // change icons, etc
  });
  ```

- Added `pressButton(btn)` and `releaseButton(btn)` to simulate button press and
  release

  ```js
  pressButton("jump"); // triggers onButtonPress and starts onButtonDown
  releaseButton("jump"); // triggers onButtonRelease and stops onButtonDown
  ```

- Added `GameObjRaw.tags` to get a game object's tags

  ```js
  const obj = add([sprite("bean"), "enemy", "dangerous"]);

  // get the tags
  debug.log(obj.tags); // ["enemy", "dangerous"]
  ```

- Added the `animate()` component to _animate_ the properties of an object using
  keyframes. Check out
  [Animation Example](https://play.kaplayjs.com/?example=animation)

  ```js
  // prop to animate, frames, options
  rotatingBean.animate("angle", [0, 360], {
      duration: 2,
      direction: "forward",
  });
  ```

- Readded `layers()` and the `layer()` component

  Before the `z()` component, there was a `layer()` component that allowed you
  to control the draw order of objects. It was removed in v3000, but now it's
  back from the void.

  ```js
  // define the layers
  layers(
      [
          "bg",
          "game",
          "ui",
          // the default layer
      ],
      "game",
  );

  // use the layer component
  add([sprite("bg"), layer("bg")]);
  ```

- Added `SpriteComp.hasAnim()` to check if an animation exists

  ```js
  const obj = add([sprite("bean", { anim: "walk" })]);

  // check if an animation exists
  debug.log(obj.hasAnim("walk")); // true
  ```

- Added `SpriteComp.getAnim()` for get any animation data

  ```js
  loadSprite("bean", "bean.png", {
      sliceX: 4,
      sliceY: 1,
      anims: {
          walk: {
              from: 0,
              to: 3,
          },
      },
  });

  const obj = add([sprite("bean")]);

  // get the animation data
  debug.log(obj.getAnim("walk")); // { from: 0, to: 3 }
  ```

- Added `SpriteComp.getCurAnim()` to get the current animation data

  ```js
  const obj = add([sprite("bean", { anim: "walk" })]);

  // get the current animation name
  debug.log(obj.getCurAnim().name); // "walk"
  ```

- Added `camFlash()` to flash the screen

  ```js
  camFlash(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
  ```

- Added support for radius in individual corners for `RectComp,radius`

  ```js
  add([
      rect(100, 100, {
          radius: [10, 20, 30, 40],
      }),
  ]);
  ```

- Added `loadMusic()` to load streaming audio (doesn't block in loading screen)

  ```js
  loadMusic("bgm", "bgm.mp3");

  // play the music
  play("bgm");
  ```

- Added `Vec2.fromArray()` to convert an array to a `Vec2`

  ```js
  const point = Vec2.fromArray([100, 200]); // vec2(100, 200);
  ```

- Added `Vec2.toArray()` to convert a `Vec2` to an array

  ```js
  const point = vec2(100, 200);
  const arr = point.toArray(); // [100, 200]
  ```

- Added `chooseMultiple()` to choose a random element from an array

  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const random = chooseMultiple(numbers, 3); // [3, 1, 5]
  ```

- Added `shuffle()` to shuffle an array

  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  shuffle(numbers); // [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
  ```

- Added `KAPLAYOpt.debugKey` for customizing the key used to toggle debug mode

  ```js
  kaplay({
      debugKey: "l",
  });
  ```

- Added compatibility with custom properties in debug mode

  ```js
  const obj = add([
      sprite("bean"),
      {
          health: 100, // on debug.inspect
          damage: 10, // on debug.inspect
          hp() {
              this.health -= this.damage;
          }, // not on debug.inspect
      },
  ]);

  // see the custom properties in debug mode
  debug.inspect = true;
  ```

- Added effector components: `areaEffector()`, `buoyancyEffector()`,
  `pointEffector()`, `surfaceEffector()`
- Added `constantForce()` component
- Added `pathfinder()` component to calculate a list of waypoints on a graph
- Added `patrol()` component to move along a list of waypoints
- Added `sentry()` component to notify when certain objects are in sight
- Added `NavMesh` class for pathfinding on a mesh
- Added `particles()` component to emit and draw particles
- Added `SpriteComp.animFrame` to get the frame of the current animation (not on
  the spritesheet)
- Added `outline()`, `shader()`, and `area()` properties to `debug.inspect`
- Added `getSceneName()` to get the current scene name
- Added `Color.toArray()` to convert a color to an array
- Added `raycast` and `LevelComp.raycast` method to level
- Added support for textured polygons
- Added support for concave polygon drawing
- Added support for arrays in uniforms
- Added support for texture larger than 2048x2048
- Added support for gravity direction
- Added line join (bevel, miter, round) and line caps (square, round)
- Added quadratic bezier and Catmull-Rom evaluation
- Added evaluation of the first and second derivatives for all splines
- Added higher order easing functions linear, steps and cubic-bezier

### Changed

- Now collision checks are only done if there's area objects
- Now you can use arrays in all input handlers

  ```js
  onKeyPress(["w", "up"], () => {
      player.jump();
  });
  ```

- Now gamepad events return what gamepad triggered the action

  ```js
  onGamepadButtonPress("south", (btn, gp) => {
      console.log(gp.index); // gamepad number on navigator's gamepad list
  });
  ```

- Now `ScaleComp` and `SpriteComp` uses setters/getters for it's state

  ```js
  const obj = add([sprite("bean"), scale(2)]);

  // set it with = syntax
  obj.scale = vec2(3, 4);
  obj.sprite = "bag";
  ```

- Now you can type `get()` with a type parameter and passing component types

  ```ts
  const player = get<BodyComp>("player");
  ```

- Now you can pass an `AudioBuffer` to `loadSound()`
- Now `debug.log()` accepts multiple argument of any type, like `console.log()`
- Now `Key` also accepts a string as an acceptable value
- Now `text()` component doesn't require to pass a string
- Now `camScale()` and `camPos()` accept only 1 number as parameter
- Now `shake()` can be called without args
- Now `loadShader()` and `loadShaderURL()` accepts null for unused parameters
- Now `RectCompOpt` accepts a array of numbers for `radius`

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `kaboom()` in favor of `kaplay()` (you can still use `kaboom*`)
- Deprecated `SpriteComp.curAnim()` in favor of `SpriteComp.getCurAnim().name`
- Deprecated `fadeIn` component in favor of `OpacityComp.fadeIn()`
- Deprecated `Event`, `EventHandler` and `EventController` in favor of `KEvent`,
  `KEventHandler` and `KEventController`

### Removed

- **(!)** Removed compatibility to use two KAPLAY frames in the same page
- **(!)** Many TypeScript definitions were fixed, if you use TypeScript now
  maybe you see new errors that make your code strict
- Fix error screen not showing with not Error object
- Fix error where debug screen was scaling bad the blue rectangles
- Fix error where error screen was not showing when the error was thrown in a
  input event
- Fix error where fonts was cropped in the bottom
- Fix an error where `stay()` object loose their input events on scene change
